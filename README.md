# Computational-Musicology

For my corpus I would like to dive deep into soundtracks. Virtually any piece of music which is used or specifically written for a movie, tv series, documentary or game can be classified as a soundtrack. It is a typical subgenre which mostly has a niche fanbase and the music is generally of a longer length. And it is mostly served as an addition to media, but many people listen to this music standalone and visit concerts in which such soundtracks are performed. I chose it because I am personally a big fan of soundtracks and I am also creating soundtracks myself.  It would be interesting to found out what the similarities and differences between various movie soundtracks are, in terms of length, dynamics, the use of vocals or energy level. Possible comparisons could include: soundtracks for different types of media compared (games, movies, documentaries, games), soundtracks of arthouse movies vs mainstream movies; long vs short soundtracks; collections soundtracks of specific composers compared with the ones from other composers; comparisons of works of one specific composer; a comparison between the title track and the other supportive tracks within one specific score. 
I would have to make a rough selection of soundtracks, since there are so many. I think it would be best to create a corpus in which there is a huge variety between the style of the soundtracks to get the most interesting results. When one thinks of soundtracks, mainly orchestral pieces by Hans Zimmer or John Williams come to mind. They are so well known, because they feature in movies which are known by a large audience, like the soundtracks from Batman or Star Wars. But there are also soundtracks out there which include only a single instrument, or only electronic elements, like the track ‘’Tick of the Clock’’ by Chromatics, which features in the movie Drive and has been widely used in many other types of media.
